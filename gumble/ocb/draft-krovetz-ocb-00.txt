Abstract

   This document specifies OCB 2.0, a shared-key encryption scheme
   combining privacy and authenticity.  This blockcipher-based, single-
   pass mechanism provides privacy and authenticity for a message, plus
   authenticity for any associated header.  It does this in the most
   simple and efficient way known.

1  Introduction

   An authenticated-encryption scheme allows parties who share a key to
   communicate in a way that ensures both privacy and authenticity.
   This document specifies the authenticated-encryption scheme OCB 2.0.
   The method is a refinement, based on work of Rogaway [Offsets], to
   Rogaway, Bellare, and Black's original OCB [OCB1].  The latter was,
   in turn, a refinement to Jutla's IAPM [Jutla].  Henceforth in this
   document, "OCB" is understood to mean OCB 2.0.

   OCB depends on a blockcipher, typically AES [AES].  Encryption and
   decryption employ a nonce N, which must be selected as a new value
   for each encryption.  OCB allows a header H to be specified when one
   encrypts or decrypts a string.  The plaintext message M and the
   header H can have any bitlength.  The ciphertext (C, T) one gets by
   encrypting M in the presence of H consists of a ciphertext core C
   having the same length as M, plus an authentication tag T.  If
   desired, the user may truncate T.

   OCB encryption protects the privacy of M and and the authenticity of
   H, N, and M.  It does this using h + m + 2 blockcipher calls, where h
   is the blocklength of H and m is the blocklength of M.  If H is fixed
   during a session then, after preprocessing, there is effectively no
   cost to have H authenticated, and the mode will use m + 2 blockcipher
   calls.  OCB requires a single key K for the underlying blockcipher,
   and all blockcipher calls are keyed by K.  OCB is on-line: one need
   not know the length of H or M to proceed with encryption, nor need
   one know the length of H or C to proceed with decryption.  OCB is
   parallelizable: the bulk of its blockcipher calls can be performed
   simultaneously.  Computational work beyond blockcipher calls consists
   of a small and fixed number of logical operations per call.  OCB
   enjoys provable security: the mode of operation is secure assuming
   that the underlying blockcipher is secure.

   Two characteristics differentiate OCB 2.0 from its predecessor.  The
   first is the built-in capability of handling the header H, and the
   second is the simpler way in which offsets are computed.

   Pending patent applications submitted by Rogaway apply to OCB.

2  Notation and Basic Operations

   There are two types of variables used in this specification, strings
   and integers.  String variables are always written with an initial
   upper-case letter while integer variables are written in all lower-
   case.  Functions, except for the simple ones defined in this section,
   are written in all upper-case.  Whenever a variable is followed by an
   underscore ("_"), the underscore is intended to denote a subscript,
   with the subscripted expression requiring evaluation to resolve the
   meaning of the variable.  For example, when i = 2, then M_i refers to
   the variable M_2.

   The following operations are used throughout the definition of OCB.

     c^i            The integer c raised to the i-th power.

     ceil(x)        The smallest integer no smaller than x.

     bitlength(S)   The length of string S in bits (eg, bitlength(101) =
                    3).

     zeros(n)       The string made of n zero-bits.

     S xor T        The string that is the bitwise exclusive-or of S and
                    T.  Strings S and T must have the same length.

     S[i]           The i-th bit of the string S (indices begin at 1).

     S[i..j]        The substring of S consisting of bits i through j.

     S || T         The string S concatenated with string T (eg, 000 ||
                    111 = 000111).

     S << n         The string S shifted left n bit positions.  More
                    formally, S << n = S[n+1..bitlength(S)] || zeros(n).

     num2str(x, n)  The n-bit binary representation of the integer x.
                    More formally, the n-bit string S where x = S[1] *
                    2^{n-1} + S[2] * 2^{n-2} + ... + S[n] * 2^{0}.  Only
                    used when 0 <= x < 2^n.

     const(n)       The lexicographically first n-bit string C among all
                    strings that have a minimal possible number of "1"
                    bits and which name a polynomial x^n + C[1] *
                    x^{n-1} + ... + C[n-1] * x^1 + C[n] * x^0 that is
                    irreducible over the field with two elements.  In
                    particular, const(128) = num2str(135, 128).  For
                    other values of n, refer to a standard table of

                    irreducible polynomials [Irred].

     times2(S)      S << 1 if S[1] = 0, and (S << 1) xor
                    const(bitlength(S)) if S[1] = 1.

     times3(S)      times2(S) xor S


3  OCB Parameters

   OCB requires the services of a blockcipher.  The selection of a
   blockcipher defines the following constants and functions.

     BLOCKLEN         The length of the plaintext block that the block-
                      cipher operates on.

     KEYLEN           The blockcipher's key length, in bits.

     ENCIPHER(K,P)    The application of the blockcipher on P (a string
                      of BLOCKLEN bits) using key K (a string of KEYLEN
                      bits).

     DECIPHER(K,C)    The application of the inverse of the blockcipher
                      on C (a string of BLOCKLEN bits) using key K (a
                      string of KEYLEN bits).

   As an example, if AES is used with 192-bit keys, then BLOCKLEN would
   equal 128 (because AES employs 128-bit blocks), KEYLEN would equal
   192, ENCIPHER would refer to the AES function, and DECIPHER would
   refer to its inverse.


4  Header Authentication: PMAC

   OCB has the ability to authenticate unencrypted data (a "header") at
   the same time that it authenticates and encrypts a message.  The
   following function is central to providing this functionality.

   Function name:
     PMAC
   Input:
     K, string of KEYLEN bits
     H, string of any length        // Header to co-authenticate
   Output:
     Auth, string of BLOCKLEN bits  // Header authenticator

   Compute Auth using the following algorithm.

7  Security Considerations

   OCB achieves two security properties, message privacy and message
   authenticity.  Privacy is "indistinguishability from random bits",
   meaning that an adversary is unable to distinguish OCB-outputs from
   an equal number of random bits.  Authenticity is "authenticity of
   ciphertexts", meaning that an adversary is unable to produce any
   valid (N,C,T) triple that it has not already acquired.  The privacy
   and the authenticity guarantee depend on the underlying blockcipher
   being secure in the sense of a strong pseudorandom permutation.  Thus

INTERNET-DRAFT                     OCB                        March 2005


   if OCB is used with a blockcipher that is not secure as a strong
   pseudorandom permutation, the security guarantees vanish.  The need
   for the strong pseudorandom permutation property means that OCB
   should be used with a conservatively designed, well-trusted
   blockcipher, such as AES.

   Both the privacy and the authenticity properties of OCB degrade as
   per s^2 / 2^BLOCKLEN, where s is the total number of blocks that the
   adversary acquires.  The consequence of this formula is that the
   proven security vanishes when s becomes as large as 2^{BLOCKLEN/2}.
   Thus the user should never use a key to generate an amount of
   ciphertext that is near to, or exceeds, 2^{BLOCKLEN/2} blocks.
   Blockciphers typically have blocksizes of 64 or 128 bits, and the
   above restriction is a significant one if the blocklength is not more
   than 64 bits.  Therefore OCB should be used with a blockcipher having
   a blocklength of 128 bits.  The mode may then be used to encrypt at
   most 2^48 blocks (2^56 bits), to ensure that s^2 / 2^128 will be at
   most 2^{-32}.

   It is crucial that, as one encrypts strings, one does not repeat a
   nonce.  The security definitions assume this, for both privacy and
   authenticity.  The implementor must ensure that, with overwhelming
   probability, this assumption is achieved by the implementation that
   uses OCB.  The nonce need not be secret, and a counter may be used
   for it.  If two parties send OCB-encrypted messages to one another
   using the same key, then the space of nonces used by the two parties
   should be partitioned so that no nonce that could be used by one
   party to encrypt could be used by the other to encrypt.

   When a ciphertext decrypts as "invalid" it is the implementor's
   responsibility to make sure that no information beyond this fact is
   made adversarially available.

   OCB encryption produces a tag T of BLOCKLEN bits.  The user may
   choose to use a prefix of T.  The length taglen of the prefix used
   impacts the adversary's ability to forge: it will always be trivial
   for the adversary to forge with probability 2^{-taglen}.  It is up to
   the application designer to choose an appropriate value for taglen.
   For typical applications, the value should be 64 or more.  The taglen
   value should be determined at session setup and should be dictated by
   the message recipient.  The taglen value is not authenticated by the
   OCB algorithm and one must ensure that an attacker can not convince a
   recipient to employ unreasonably short authentication tags.

   Timing attacks are not a part of the formal model and an
   implementation should take care to ensure that these are not
   damaging.  To render timing attacks impotent, the amount of time to
   encrypt or decrypt a string should be independent of the key and the

   contents of the string.  Implementations of times2(S) that employ a
   conditional for inspecting bit S[1] are particularly suspect and
   should be avoided.  Power-usage attacks are likewise out of scope of
   the formal model, and should be considered for environments where
   they are threatening.

   The OCB encryption scheme reveals in the ciphertext the length of the
   plaintext.  Sometimes the length of the plaintext is a valuable piece
   of information that should be hidden.  For environments where
   "traffic analysis" is a concern, techniques beyond OCB encryption
   (typically involving padding) would be necessary.


8  Acknowledgments

   The design of the original OCB scheme [OCB1] was done while Phil
   Rogaway was at Chiang Mai University, Thailand.  Follow-up work
   [Offsets] was done with support from NSF 0208842 and a gift from
   Cisco.  Current funding for Rogaway is from the same NSF award and a
   gift from Intel.


Appendix - Test Vectors

   The following test vectors have been developed for use in validating
   implementations of OCB.  All strings are represented in hexadecimal
   (ie, 0F represents the bitstring 00001111).  The blockcipher used in
   all cases is AES with a 128-bit keylength.  The key (K) and nonce (N)
   for all vectors are

     K : 000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F
     N : 000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F

   The following is a collection of header (H) and message (M) pairs,
   and the ciphertext (C) and authentication tag (T) pairs generated for
   each defined <K, N, H, M>.  A blank entry indicates the empty string.
